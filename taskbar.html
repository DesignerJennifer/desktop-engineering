                <p> End users are... well, I'm sure some are great people, even if they aren't always the most discriminating when
                    choosing what to click. A common support call is when the user can't access his or her email, because they
                    clicked the mail icon on the taskbar and brought up the built-in Mail App instead of Outlook, or whatever client they are supposed to use. Maybe
                    you'd like to remove this, or Cortana, or pin other apps to the bar. You can set up the taskbar however you'd
                    like on the reference machine, and then export the settings with</p>

                    <div>
                        <code>Export-StartLayout -UseDesktopApplicationID -path .\ DefaultLayouts.xml</code>
                    </div>

                <p> The path ".\" is the current directory you're in inside your PowerShell console. Copy that file into a folder on
                    your deployment share, and create a new PowerShell script in the folder. We're going to have the script copy the file for us. We could have also
                    used the <code>Import-StartLayout</code> command on a mounted image, but I prefer this method. Our script will
                    look like this:</p>

                    <div>
                        <code>Copy-Item -Force .\DefaultLayouts.xml 'C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\DefaultLayouts.xml</code>
                    </div>

                <p> Don't be intimidated by the "-Force" switch, we're not putting something where it doesn't belong, we're only
                    suppressing potential prompts like, "A file exists in this location, would you like to overwrite? Y/N/A"</p>
