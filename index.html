            <div class="headline">Why use PowerShell?</div>

            <div>
                <p> PowerShell is Microsoft's cross-platform command line interface and scripting language. Generally
                    PowerShell is understood to be a tool for server administration, and not used on PCs by support
                    staff.
                    In fact, it is enabled by default on Windows Server 2019, but is disabled on Windows 10. So why are
                    we
                    using it on desktop computers? Well, because we can! It allows us to automate repetitive tasks, each
                    script is itself a record of the changes we make, it allows us to manage systems remotely, it comes
                    with
                    Windows by default, it's powerful and it's free. There's a series of videos that serve as a great
                    introduction
                    <a href=https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Getting-Started-with-Microsoft-PowerShell target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: blue">here.</a>
                </p>

                <p>This site will probably be of interest mostly to Desktop Techs, Bench Techs, HelpDesk staff, or
                    anyone
                    supporting the end user. The focus will be on deployment - that is, preparing computers for others,
                    but
                    they can be used for remote support, or even just run from a flash drive. I'm writing it mainly for
                    myself, to reinforce my own learning, but I would be overjoyed if someone was able to find something
                    here that is
                    useful to him or her. I won't cover how to set up a deployment server, but if you don't have one,
                    you
                    may want to start

                    with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit and the Workbench.

                Advice to Beginners
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>There's a few things that anyone, regardless of skill level, should keep in mind when writing and
                    running
                    scripts.</p>
                <ol start="1">
                    <li class="num-li">Read and understand any script before you run it.</li>

                    <p>If you are using a script or snippet that someone else wrote, whether it's from a random internet
                        post, official documentation, or a contractor, you should be able to explain what exactly a
                        script
                        does and why before you run it. This is paramount to learning, and being proficient in
                        PowerShell
                        can be a great boon to a career for anyone working in Information Technology or a related field.
                        More importantly, if you don't know what the script is doing, you could potentially cause great
                        damage. The writer may not know peculiarities of your particular environment, or he may be
                        incompetent, or he may be purposefully malicious. Here, the Get-Help cmdlet and -WhatIf switch
                        can
                        be extremely useful.
                    </p>

                    <li class="num-li">Measure twice, cut once.</li>
                    <p>Excuse the hackneyed expression, it's fitting here. Be meticulous. Be thoughtful. Be slow, if
                        necessary, because it will save you time in the long run. If you're writing a script for a task
                        that
                        takes 10 minutes, and will be run on 300 machines, you are saving 50 hours of work. You can
                        afford
                        to take an extra half-hour to make sure your script works precisely the way you want.
                    </p>

                    <li class="num-li">Develop good habits.</li>

                    <p>There's the easy way and there's the correct way, and frankly speaking, when it comes to
                        scripting,
                        it's usually the same damn thing. But sometimes it's not, and if you find yourself putting out
                        fires, you may want to jump in "real quick" and do something a hundred times manually, clicking
                        through menus, or just assign the intern to do it. Don't. Open your IDE and get some practice.
                        Also,
                        if you start to notice that your scripts could be described as "hacky," you need to step back
                        and
                        reevaluate your methods. If you aren't proud of your script, you need to rewrite it until you
                        are.
