                <div class="headline">Why use PowerShell?</div>

                <div>
                    <p> PowerShell is Microsoft's cross-platform command line interface and scripting language. Generally PowerShell is understood to be a tool for server administration, and not used on PCs by support staff. In fact, it is enabled by default
                        on Windows Server 2019, but is disabled on Windows 10. So why are we using it on desktop computers? Well, because we can! It allows us to automate repetitive tasks, each script is itself a record of the changes we make, it allows
                        us to manage systems remotely, it comes with Windows by default, it's powerful and it's free. There's a series of videos that serve as a great introduction
                        <a href=https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Getting-Started-with-Microsoft-PowerShell target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: blue">here.</a>
                    </p>

                </div>


                <div class="headline">
                    Who is this site for?
                </div>

                <p>I hope anyone and everyone! Realistically, IT support staff such as Desktop Technicians, Bench Technicians, and HelpDesk staff will find it most useful since the focus is on desktop deployment and support. I won't cover how to set up a
                    deployment server, but if you don't have one, you may want to start
                    <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/deploy-windows-mdt/get-started-with-the-microsoft-deployment-toolkit target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: blue">here</a> first, and get familiar with the
                    Microsoft Deployment Toolkit and the Workbench. But just tech enthusiasts may like the idea of using PowerShell to configure their home PC, or superusers looking for an extra edge. The scripts here are not overly elaborate or complicated,
                    and I consider myself as somewhat of a beginner, but perhaps even gurus may find it as a reference useful, as the focus is so narrow, aimed at the workstation, so maybe if you're a cloud expert or a server administrator with plenty
                    of experience, you'll still find something to spark ideas and imagination.

                    Advice to Scripters
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>There's a few things that anyone, regardless of skill level, should keep in mind when writing and running scripts.
                    </p>
                    <ol start="1">
                        <li class="num-li">Read and understand any script before you run it.</li>

                        <p> It doesn't even have to be a malicious script - PowerShell is powerful and it will do whatever you tell it to. You can do a lot of damage if you don't know precisely how the script will interact with your environment. Here, the
                            Get-Help cmdlet and -WhatIf switch can be extremely useful.

                        </p>

                        <li class="num-li">Take your time.</li>
                        <p> You're saving loads of time by writing the script to begin with, it's worth it to take some extra time to make sure your code is up to snuff. Especially since you may be reusing it later.
                        </p>

                        <li class="num-li">Find ways to practice.</li>
                        <p> Try to do everything in PowerShell. On Helpdesk, I like resolving common tickets with PowerShell. Use it for password resets, clearing caches, changing settings, and you'll end up very comfortable in the console. Then when you
                            start writing more challenging scripts, you'll have a stronger foundation.
                        </p>
