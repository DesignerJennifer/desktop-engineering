    <p> Sometimes when you're on a support call, you'll need to send files to the user's machine, put icons on their
        desktop, rename things, etc. As long as you're an administrator on the same domain, you can do these tasks in
        File Explorer, as long as
        File and Printer Sharing is enabled. Sometimes you'll hear technicians talk about 'sea dollaring' into their
        machine. That's because in File Explorer, you'll access their C:\ drive by typing '\\machine_name\c$'. But it's
        turned off by default, so
        we will enable it with this one-liner:</p>

        <div class="codeBlock">
            <code>Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "File and Printer Sharing" -Enabled True -Profile Any</code>
        </div>

    <p> As handy as it is to access a user's file system, we'll want to go one further, and be able to run PowerShell
        commands as if we were typing directly on their machine. The following command will allow us, later, to do this
        with the command:
        <div>
            <code>Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "remote_computer"</code>
        </div>

    <p> and replace "remote_computer" with their device's name. But first we need to enable it, with this intuitive
        command:</p>
        <code>Enable-PSRemoting</code>

    <p>Even if your organization is paying
        for remote support software, I would still recommend enabling these. Typically, retail remote software will
        allow you to take control of the user's desktop and they can see what you're doing in real time. If you use
        these tools, you can
        work on their machine without disrupting them. All the user will know is that they have submitted a ticket, and
        fifteen minutes later got an email from IT that it's been resolved. They'll think you're a magician!</p>
