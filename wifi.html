    <div class="headline">Adding Wifi</div>
    <div>
        <p> There's really no reason to use a laptop if it doesn't have a wireless connection, so let's add one. First, you'll need to set up wifi on a reference machine. It doesn't matter if it's password protected (PSK) or authenticated with your Windows Session 
            credentials - just log into your network account and connect to it. We're going to use the netsh tool. In the console, you can type in <code>netsh wlan show profiles</code> to get a list of connections. Find your connection, and type in</p>

            <div>
                <code>
                    netsh wlan export profile name="wifi name" key=clear folder=c:\
                </code>
            </div>

        <p> Replace "wifi name" with the name of your connection. Check in your c:\ drive and you should have an XML file named "wifi name.xml". Create a new folder on your deployment share on the MDT server, copy over the file, and create a PowerShell script in
            the same folder with it. You can name it wireless_profile.ps1. We'll only need one line here as well:</p>
        
        <div>
            <code>
                netsh wlan add profile filename= '.\wifi name.xml' user=all
            </code>
        </div>
        
        <p> The user=all is an important bit here. Since the user hasn't logged in yet, 
            they don't have a profile on the machine. If we didn't include it, it would only add the wifi connection to the local administrator account. Giving wifi access to all users isn't a security concern if the environment is set up correctly, since a bad actor 
            would still need to have domain credentials to log into Windows in the first place.</p>
