        <p> There's a few different ways we can use PowerShell to help us deploy software to our users. One great tool is <a href=https://chocolatey.org target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: blue">Chocolatey</a>. You can find a list of publicly maintained software packages on their site, but bear in 
            mind that this can have drawbacks. If you use their packages, you're relying on an anonomyous user to keep it updated and free from malware, and of course they aren't likely to have all of the enterprise software your organization will be using. However, for common
            free apps like Google Chrome, Adobe Reader, and VLC, this can be a quick and easy solution. Of course, you can also set up your own software repository, but I won't cover that here since the website already has good instructions on how to do this. So,
            to use the publicly maintained packages, we'll write a script that looks like this:</p>

            <div class="code_block">
                <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
                    <br>choco upgrade vlc -y<br>choco upgrade adobereader -y<br>choco upgrade silverlight -y
                </code>
            </div>

        <p> So you can pretty easily tell what the script is doing, first it installs Chocolatey, then VLC, Adobe Reader, and Silverlight. The -y switch simply answers 'yes' to the prompt that comes up asking if you want to install.</p>
        <p> Of course, we can also install MSI or EXE packages with PowerShell. The main problem we'll run into is passing switches- if we simply run the installer, a window will open and the script will pause, and you'll be clicking 'Next... Next... Next...' What we 
            want is to do a silent install. To do that, we need to pass switches. Most MSI installers support the /s /v /qn switches. You can use these in Command Prompt, but not PowerShell. So we'll use the <code>cmd /c</code> command to run it as if we were
            using Command Prompt. So we'll put our script in the same folder as our package, and run it with the following:<div><code>cmd /c msiexec.exe "setup.msi" /s /v /qn</code></div><p> Just replace "setup.msi" with the name of your package. Your EXE files may support similar
            switches, so just instead of running msiexec.exe, you'd run the command with PowerShell's "invokation" which is the ampersand character: <code>&</code></p>
        </p>
        <p> You may run into an unfortunate situation where there is some ancient program, or one built by some contractor who has long since left, that does not support silent installation. You may be stuck manually entering server names, IP addresses, spending your
            life clicking 'Next... Next... Next...'. You may considering quitting and going back to school to become a veterinarian. But there is one other option, and that's <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: blue">AutoHotkey</a>. You can use this tool to write scripts
            to simulate control of the keyboard and mouse. I've had some success, but the scripts are not reliable like PowerShell, they will often break. This article won't cover how to write these scripts right now, but I may add a section later.
